        <h3>Ideal passive circuit elements</h3>
        <h4>Resistor</h4>
        <img src="Images/2.png">
        <h4>Capacitor</h4>
        Capacitor is an one-port element for which current through the element depends on
        velocity (derivate) of voltage along the element.<br>
        <img src="Images/3.png">
        <br>
        Obs.: Capacitor is a symmetric element (it does not matter how it is connected in
        circuit).<br>
        <img src="Images/4.png">
        <br>
        where t0 is the initial time, u(t0) is the voltage at initial time (initial voltage or initial condition of the
        capacitor).
        <br>Obs.: Voltage along a capacitor has a continuous variation in time (at initial time, voltage is the same,
        u(t0)). But the current does not have a continuous variation in time (a jump of current at initial time).
        <br>
        <img src="Images/5.png">
        <br>
        <img src="Images/6.png">
        <h4>Inductor</h4>
        Inductor is an one-port element for which voltage along the element depends on velocity (derivate) of current
        through the element.
        <br>
        <img src="Images/7.png">

        <br>
        <img src="Images/8.png">
        <br>
        where t0 is the initial time, i(t0) is the current at initial time (initial current or initial condition of the
        inductor).
        <br>
        Obs.: Current through an inductor has a continuous variation in time (at initial time,current is the same,
        i(t0)). But the voltage does not have a continuous variation in time(a jump of voltage at initial time).

        <h4>Coupled inductors (inductors with mutual coupling)</h4>
        Coupled inductors represent a multi-ports element. So, two coupled inductors mean a two-ports elements.
        <br>
        <img src="Images/11.png">
        <br>
        There is a magnetic coupling between two inductors, so the inductors are not independently.
        <br>
        The voltage along one inductor depends on velocity (derivate) of current through the inductor and velocity
        (derivate) of current through the other inductor from the magnetic coupling.
        <br>
        Obs.: Magnetic coupling is represented by stars (polarized terminals).
        <br>
        <img src="Images/12.png">
        <br>
        Obs.: For both inductors, the voltage and current are oriented according to receiver convention.
        <br>
        L1=L11 is the self inductance of the first inductor<br>
        L2=L22 is the self inductance of the second inductor<br>
        M=L12=L21 is the mutual inductance of the two inductors<br>
        Obs.: L1>0, L2>0, M>0 or M<0. <br>
            Mutual inductance is positive if the currents through the two coupled inductors have
            the same orientation related to polarized terminals (both currents are going in
            polarized terminals or both currents are going out polarized terminals).
            <br>
            Mutual inductance is negative if the currents through the two coupled inductors have
            different orientation related to polarized terminals (one current is going in polarized
            terminal and the other current is going out polarized terminal).
            <br>
            <img src="Images/13.png">
            <br>
            Obs.: if M=0, there is no magnetic coupling between inductors, so the inductors are
            independently<br>
            <img src="Images/14.png">
            <br>
            Obs.: The electric transformer represents two inductors with magnetic coupling.

        The non-linear element is an one port element for which the dependance between voltage along
        the element and current through the element has a non-linear character.

        <h4>Non-linear ideal resistor</h4>
        Non-linear resistor represents an one port element for which the relation between voltage and
        current is a non-linear algebraic equation.

        Non-linear inductor represents an one port element for which the voltage at terminals depends on
        the variation in time (velocity) of magnetic flux through inductor, and the dependence between
        magnetic flux and current is a non-linear function.
